	@brief		This class handles the loading of the pack.
	@details
				Since the whole pack is completely dependant on Broadcast being installed,
				we wait until Broadcast itself signals that it is ready before loading.

				The loader also handles de/activation since it too is problematic due
				to Broadcast not existing when we need it.
